Before building the program:
-If you would like to resolve multiple IP addresses per hostname,
 open multi-lookup.c and uncomment the define at line 40: MULTI_IP
-Otherwise, no changes need to be made

To build:
-Navigate to the directory where multi-lookup.c is located and
 type "make" in the terminal to make all targets
-"make clean" should remove all built objects

To run:
-See example:
	./multi-lookup input/names1.txt input/names2.txt results.txt

-The input files can be changed, so just type the path of each input
 txt file after ./multi-lookup.  At the end, give a target output
 txt file.  You must provide at least 1 input file and 1 output
 file, and a maximum of 10 input name files.

Extra Credit:
1. When MULTI_IP is defined as a positive integer, the program should output up to MULTI_IP different ipv4 strings, separated by commas,
after each hostname in the output file.

2. The number of resolver threads should match the number of
processor cores configured on the system.
